# How Data Platforms Work

The **How Data Platforms Work** book is a book published monthly in association to the [Monthly Python Data Engineering Newsletter](https://alessandromolina.substack.com/archive) that explains how data platforms work at low level.

The book tries to be a lightweight and quick introduction to the topic allowing readers to build the foundations that they might need to deep dive into the implementation details of their favorite solutions.

**DataPyground** is the data platform built to showcase the concepts explained in the book and to allow readers of the book to experiment on their own over an existing codebase that is easy enough to understand for a person learning about core concepts like compute engines, dataframe apis etc...
