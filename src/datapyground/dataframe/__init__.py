"""Dataframe library built on top of datapyground.

A dataframe library is a tool designed to handle and manipulate structured data, 
typically in the form of tables (i.e., rows and columns). 
It allows users to load data from various sources (like CSV files or databases), 
explore it, apply transformations, and analyze it. 

Dataframes provide an efficient way to perform operations such as filtering, 
aggregation, and merging of datasets.

Dataframes are becoming a widespread and convenient
way to perform analyses on data, they are now as widespread
as SQL as a way to run queries on data. The most commonly
used ones are probably ``pandas`` and ``polars``.

This module shows how to implement a custom dataframe library,
using the datapyground compute capabilities as its foundation.
